# CyberConnect Indexer

Core part of CyberConnect Protocol doesn't include providing specific services to varies decentralized social media applications. 

However, for early stage of development, CyberConnect team set up indexers that implements CyberConnect Protocol and hence help early community developers easily on board.

We are now offering two GraphQL APIs: **Identity** and **Recommendation**. You can get an address' follower & following list, get recommendation list through our indexer GraphQL api.

We understand a lot of our community developers only use REST API before. If you are not familiar with GraphQL yet, you may refer to [GraphQL Official Site](https://graphql.org/) for 
quick introduction and tutorial. 

You can also join our discord group and ask for help in "developer" channel. CyberConnect is a global dev team and we are glad to give you tech support there!

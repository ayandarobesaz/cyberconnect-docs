# Namespace

CyberConnect provides isolated environment for different social connection scenarios. In order to get the follower, following, friend list of an address, you need to specify `namespace` variable. 

If no `namespace` value is received by the indexer, full connections in all namespaces that meet requirements will be returned. You can create a new space by specifying `namespace` variable with a unique value.

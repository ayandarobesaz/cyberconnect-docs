# Namespace

CyberConnect is a protocol used for address connections of different networks, applications. In order to get the follower, following, friend list of an address, you need to specify `namespace` variable. 

The default namespace is `CyberConnect`, which is provided and maintained by CyberConnect team. The official site of CyberConnect use this namespace and hence there are a lot of existed connections in this namespace. 

If you are an individual developer, and you want to use the data from a big social connection network, this could be a good choice. If your application needs a new and independent network, you can use CyberConnect SDK to append new connections and use the indexer to query with your namespace.

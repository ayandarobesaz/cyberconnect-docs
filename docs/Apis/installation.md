# SDK Installation

The CyberConnect JavaScript SDK provides two primary functions, **connect** and **disconnect**, which in social graph are **follow** and **unfollow**. 

The library encapsulates the complex authentication logic (authenticate to Ceramic Network) into easy-to-use functions. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/js-cyberconnect).

For installation, simply run:

```bash
npm install @cyberlab/cyberconnect
or
yarn add @cyberlab/cyberconnect
```

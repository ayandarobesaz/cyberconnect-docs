# What is CyberConnect Protocol?
CyberConnect is a protocol for users to easily create social connections, manage them, and take them to all applications that are in CyberConnect’s ecosystem. CyberConnect returns the ownership of social data back to users - connections formed on CyberConnect are “assets” that are truly owned by users, analogous to how  tokens are assets truly owned by their holder.   

CyberConnect is also a protocol that developers can adopt and leverage to facilitate building their own project’s social features. Similar to "log in with Facebook" or "allow local contact book access" for a new platform, developers can tap into CyberConnect and leverage users' existing social connections to build a multiplayer social app, game, social trading, and DAOs.

It’s also a huge recommendation system or network engine for developers to contextualize a user, to provide a smart default, to recommend new connections and content. It’s like “you both worked at Google” on LinkedIn, or “you two are both interested in NFTs” on Pinterest. We attach a layer of social identity to wallet addresses - instead of looking at “0xabcxxxxxxx123”, you'll instead see “Your friend ryanli.eth” or “Your coworker at FWB”. Instead of seeing “please follow at least 5 people” at sign up, you'll rather see “here are folks you have interacted with on ethereum”.

CyberConnect Protocol democratizes users’ digital social connections and returns the ownership of those connections to users. Connections made here are assets belonging to users, instead of properties owned by platforms. We also make building social apps as easy as building DeFi protocols for developers, who won't need to spin up centralized servers to store social graph data - they can rely on CyberConnect for social data, just like they can always rely on ERC20 on-chain data for DeFi data.

# What is CyberConnect Protocol?

CyberConnect is a protocol for users to easily create social connections, manage them and take them to any applications built in CyberConnect ecosystem. Connections formed on CyberConnect is an “asset” that is truly owned by users just like a token sitting in users’ wallets.

CyberConnect is also a protocol for developers to easily build with social features. It’s like “login with Facebook” or “ask for local contact book access” where developers want to leverage users’ existing social connections to build a multiplayer social app, game, social trading, or DAOs.

It’s also a huge recommendation system or network engine for developers to contextualize a user, to provide a smart default, to recommend new connections and contents. It’s like “you both worked at Google” on LinkedIn or “you two are both interested in NFTs” on Pinterest. No more looking at “0xabcxxxxxxx123” but “Your friend ryanli.eth” or “Your coworker at FWB”. No more “please follow at least 5 people” at sign up but “here are folks you have interacted with on ethereum”.

All and all, CyberConnect Protocol democratizes users’ digital social connections and make them assets of users’ instead of platforms’. In return, building a social app should be as easy as building a DeFi protocol for developers where they should not spin up centralized server to store social graph data just like they should always rely on ERC20 on-chain data.

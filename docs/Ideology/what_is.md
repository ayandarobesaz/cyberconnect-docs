# What is CyberConnect Protocol?

- A protocol for users to easily create social connections, manage them, and take them to all applications that are in CyberConnect’s ecosystem. CyberConnect Protocol democratizes users’ digital social connections and returns the ownership of social data back to users - connections formed on CyberConnect are “assets” that are truly owned by users, analogous to how tokens are assets truly owned by their holder.

- A protocol that developers can adopt and leverage to facilitate building their own project’s social features. It creates a data standard, data storage infrastructure, and recommendation indexing system for social connections, providing a universal data layer for the next generation of dApps - GameFi, NFTs, DAOs - to plug in meaningful and context-specific social functions. Similar to "log in with Facebook" or "allow local contact book access" for a new platform, developers can tap into CyberConnect and leverage users' existing social connections to fast forward bootstrapping and build upon it with agility for quick iterations. There’s no longer a need to spin up centralized servers to store social graph data - they can rely on CyberConnect for social data, just like they can always rely on ERC20 on-chain data for DeFi data.

- A huge recommendation system or network engine for developers to contextualize a user, to provide a smart default, to recommend new connections and content. It’s like “you both worked at Google” on LinkedIn, or “you two are both interested in NFTs” on Pinterest. We attach a layer of social identity to wallet addresses - instead of looking at “0xabcxxxxxxx123”, you'll instead see “Your friend ryanli.eth” or “Your coworker at FWB”. Instead of seeing “please follow at least 5 people” at sign up, you'll rather see “here are folks you have interacted with on ethereum”.

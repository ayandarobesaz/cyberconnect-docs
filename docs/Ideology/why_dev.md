# Why do developers need CyberConnect?

- Most of the heavy lifting for building a Web3 app, like hosting a backend, has already been handled - layer one blockchains write transactional data, data services like OpenSea API, TheGraph, and EtherScan read indexed data, read and write metadata on IPFS and Arweave. However, there is no data standard or existing middleware to help streamline the process. Developers then have to choose to build a web2 version of social graph internally with relational database. This just creates new data silos where users end up with the same old experience - they follow a similar group of people on different platform, yet they're unable to bring those groups to the different platforms they travel to. 
- Every social app has to solve the cold start problem, for there’s no single-player mode for social. Every social app acquires users in mostly the same way, through campaigns and referrals, which achieve slow and redundant results. It’s like “rebuilding the wheels” every time you need a ride. Apps that tap into CyberConnect get user liquidity and social network data from day one. Developers can then skip over boostrapping their own social layer, and focus on building the content of their apps and delivering great experiences instead.

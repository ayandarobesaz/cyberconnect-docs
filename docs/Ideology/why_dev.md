# Why do developers need CyberConnect?

- Most of the heavy lifting for building a Web3 app, like hosting a backend, has already been handled - layer one blockchain writes transactional data, data services like OpenSea API, TheGraph, and EtherScan read indexed data, read and write metadata on IPFS and Arweave. However, there is no data standard or existing middleware to help streamline the process. Developers then have to choose #???这边没写完 choose between 啥？
    - Build a web2 version of social graph internally with relational database. This just creates new data silos where users end up with the same experience: they follow the same group of people on every platform, yet they're unable to bring those groups to the different platforms they go to. 
- User discoverability and user liquidity. Every social app has to solve the cold start problem over and over again since there’s no single player mode for social apps. #single player mode这里是什么意思？和cold start problem什么关系？Every social app acquires users in mostly the same way, through campaigns and referrals, which achieve slow and redundant results. Apps that tap into CyberConnect get user liquidity and social network data from day one. Developers can then skip over boostrapping their own social layer, and focus on building the content of their apps instead.

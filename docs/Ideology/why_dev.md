# Why do developers need CyberConnect?

- In order to build a web3 app, most of the heavy lifting like hosting a backend have already been handled by layer one blockchain (writing transactional data), data services like OpenSea API, TheGraph and EtherScan (reading indexed data), reading and writing metadata on IPFS and Arweave. However, there is no data standard, no existing middleware to help streamline the process. Developers then have to choose
    - Build a web2 version of social graph internally with relational database. This just creates new data silos where users end up with the same experience: they follow the same group of people on every platform just like you have the same group of friends on telegram, instagram and twitter.
- User discoverability and user liquidity. Every social app has to solve the cold start problem over and over again since there’s no single player mode for social app. The way every social app is mostly the same thru campaigns and referrals, so it’s like “rebuilding the wheels”. Apps that tapped into CyberConnect get user liquidity and social network data from day one. No more solving the cold start problem but build better products instead.

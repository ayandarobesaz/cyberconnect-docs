# Why do users need CyberConnect?

- You can own ERC20 tokens without going thru a bank but you have to add a friend on a specific platform. Wouldnâ€™t it be better you bring all your friends and followers along to every app instead of recreating your social connections on every other platforms?
- DeFi commoditized money markets, projects fights for providing the best service and yields instead of trying to lock in users. You know probably only a handful of banks but know more DeFi protocols. This is due to users truly own their tokens and asset, the rate of innovation and compounding is incredible. If users could truly own their social connections, social capital, there could be endless innovation for builders in social app industry. No more monopoly by a handful of apps built by Meta.

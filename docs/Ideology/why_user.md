# Why do users need CyberConnect?

- Your ERC20 tokens aren't owned by a centralized bank; your friendships should likewise not be owned by a centralized platform. Wouldnâ€™t it be better if you can bring all your friends and followers along to every app you travel to, instead of having to recreate all your social connections from scratch on every new platform you go to? 
- DeFi commoditized money markets. DeFi projects focus on providing the best services and yields instead of acquiring and maintaining users, yet you are likely happier to interact with a higher number of DeFi protocols than banks. This is because when users truly own their tokens and assets, they are incentivized to adopt and evangelize the mechanisms that allow them to do so. That incentive encourages innovation in those mechanisms, the compounding rates of which we've seen are incredible. If users could truly own their social connections and social identity, they too will be incentivized to evangelize the social app ecosystem and encourage innovation by builders of social apps. The social space will be able to escape the tyrannical reigns of a handful of apps and thrive with a boom in innovation.

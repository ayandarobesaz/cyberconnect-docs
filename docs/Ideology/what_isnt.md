# What CyberConnect Protocol is not?

A Profile Page. CyberConnect provides the necessary data standard, data availability guarantee, and developer tools for developers to build any apps that leverage a social network. [https://app.cyberconnect.me/](https://app.cyberconnect.me/) is only our first attempt of showing how this could be done with CyberConnect Protocol and we can’t wait to see more projects building profiles.

A Social Media. CyberConnect does not work on content delivery fields. We help people and developers find and manage their digital social connections, so content distribution or syndication (RSS) could leverage CyberConnect’s social graph to build distribution channels like feed.

A blockchain. Developers build on CyberConnect could treat it as a Layer one blockchain with properties like self-sovereignty and portability. However, CyberConnect protocol intentionally avoid creating another Layer one blockchain but work collectively with existing blockchains, thus being blockchain agnostic and composable. Developers don’t need to learn another language or CyberConnect and users still uses their most familiar wallets like MetaMask and Phantom.

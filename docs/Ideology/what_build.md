# What are we building?

- An Open Source Software
    - The wisdom of crowd has demonstrated that to build a long lasting technology, we have to leverage the communityâ€™s collective effort.
    - Every problem should only be solved once, we hope to build with everyone to formalize a social graph data standard and make sure that it powers all the developers
    - We should be comfortable building in public to gain trust. We should almost always default to public repo.
- Developer Community
    - We encourage people to build with us, using our provided solutions ranging from running their own on premise nodes to using our hosted APIs to using our SDKs
    - We provide docs, tutorials and learning resources for them
    - We provide explorer, verifier and tools for developers and users

# What are we building?

- An Open Source Software
    - To build a technology that withstands the test of time, we leverage the wisdom of the crowd and gather the community to collectively work on the key problems of Web3 Social. 
    - Every problem should only be solved once. We hope to build with everyone in order to establish a social graph data standard that empowers all developers. 
    - We should be comfortable building in public to gain trust. We should almost always default to public repo.
- Developer Community
    - We encourage everyone to build with us using our provided solutions - ranging from running your own on-premise nodes to using our hosted APIs and our SDKs. 
    - We provide docs, tutorials, and learning resources for you.
    - We provide explorer, verifier, and various tools for developers and users.

# CyberConnect in Decentralized Feeds

Integration between CyberConnect and decentralized feeds is intuitive and organic. Users can see content posted by their friends on CyberConnect, and follow other users based on content. Users can also send invitations and share content across different platforms through their portable CyberConnect friends list. With our recommendation system, users are also able to get cutomized people, content, and comunities recommended to them, thereby helping them explore feeds that they would have not otherwise engaged with.

# CyberConnect in DAO

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a system composed by rules and developers for a shared goal. In current moment, DAOs are lacking of communication tools. Members may find it difficult to discuss with each other, which hinders communication and efficiency of DAOs.

However, with CyberConnect, this problem could be elevated! The votes from CyberConnected friends give a sense of group thinking. DAO members can also discuss their opinions through CyberChat (a CyberConnect-based, decentralized dm application) or other decentralized chat application. For now, they could only use Discord or other Web2 chat tools for such demands.

A potential use case design is shown below. Users can see a friend voting hint before they start to read the contents of the vote and hence get more motivated to read and think carefully. Also, they can check both general votes and friends' votes, this can give him an opinion reference.

Also, CyberConnect provide featured people list, DAO developers can use this API to filter out what are opinions and decisions of stars like Vitalik, a16z... This makes the voting trend with prestigious influences while still allowing different voices, sounds like a perfect DAO ecology, isn't it?

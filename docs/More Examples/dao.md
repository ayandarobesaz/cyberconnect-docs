# CyberConnect in DAO

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a system created by developers who share the same goal and are composed of rules that are not singlehandedly decided by a central party. At the moment, DAOs lack native relationships and communication tools. Members may find it difficult to form and view connections within the DAO, which hinders the efficiency of DAOs. 

With CyberConnect, DAO members can establish and display friendships more holistically. Members can garner a friends list and see profiles of each of their friends, including information like their credentials, memberships, past votes, etc. Particularly, the votes from CyberConnected friends give a sense of group thinking. 

A potential use case design is shown below. Users can see a friend's notes for voting before they start to read the contents of the vote, and hence have more information to leverage toward voting. Also, they can check both general votes and friends' votes for reference.

Also, CyberConnect provides featured people lists API, which allows DAO developers to filter out opinions and decisions of influential people like Vitalik, a16z, SBF, etc. Members will be able to see with clarity and ease certain featured people's decision track, which adds a layer of information toward their own decision-making.

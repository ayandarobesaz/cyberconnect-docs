# CyberConnect in Chat Applications

CyberConnect allows for an easier process of building decentralized chat applications. Cold starts are prone to impede the growth of emerging chat applications due to the lack of users thus "friends" to chat with. Leveraging CyberConnect, developers can easily integrate and access the contents of users' friends lists, thereby incentivizing users to stay and engage with the app.

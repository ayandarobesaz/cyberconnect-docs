# CyberConnect in Blockchain Games

CyberConnect can be used in blockchain games for social connections. Players can access their friends, see their recent activities and even interact with them.

In Web2 era, social media monopolies usually take a big share of game industry, due to their ownership of user connection data. This will be overthrown in the Web3 time. The ownership of user connection will belong to users themselves and with users' permission, decentralized game companies can share the use of players, building a open, prosperous and freely connected communities.

The future is about to come. So, if you are considering building a de-game, definitely consider CyberConnect!

# CyberConnect in Blockchain Games

CyberConnect can be used in blockchain games for establishing friendships, displaying in-game assets, and porting identities. Games are much more fun when players can see when their friends are online and what their friends are up to in the game. In addition, players can display their in-game credentials and assets on their portable profile, which makes the gaming experience seamless and interactive across different games. 

In the Web2 era, different games are siloed communities because users don't share their connections or assets across games. In the age of Web3, the ownership of user data and connection data will belong to users themselves. Decentralized games can thus build open and freely connected communities across different platforms with the central experience focused on users instead of platforms.

# CyberConnect in Blockchain Explorer

Since the birth of Ethereum, the need for a blockchain explorer has existed. Blockchain explorer can integrate with CyberConnect for its recommendation API, backed by a deliberate recommendation algorithm and an extensive user-initiated following action dataset. 

When a viewer of the blockchain explorer searches for an address, he/she can get the searched address's profile, credentials, assets, contents, and all relational records such as transaction history. With this, a pseudonymous identity is contextualized meaningfully and from here a chain of search actions can lead to further social and content discovery.

# Hello World

Hello World is a social connection web application that allows users to discover their Ethereum network.The app successfully pulls public data on the Ethereum network and displays it as user profiles. Users can search any ETH address or ENS domain and view its net worth, the assets it holds, NFTs and POAPs it owns, ERC20 and ERC721 transfers and much more.

It wouldn't be a social app if it didn't have the follow feature where users can connect with others and also get recommendations and featured profiles on who to follow next. All of these features are made possible with CyberConnect's API.

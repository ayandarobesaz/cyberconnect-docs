# Unipass

UniPass is a multi-chain unified crypto identity, the carrier for the concept of ‘people’ in Metaverse. With UniPass’s unique Non-custodial Email-based Social Recovery solution, users can take full control of their crypto identity with a keyless experience. Users can also authenticate multi-chain addresses and even social accounts cryptographically, making their identity verifiable and more valuable.

UniPass integrated CyberConnect’s API and leverages the following and follower data to display how each user’s connected with others. UniPass is also working on a reputation system, which will employ a user’s social data on CyberConnect as a source of reputation.

The Grape NFT marketplace is the first non-custodial and composable marketplace on Solana, built for communities to curate their own marketplaces. Marketplace social interactions are powered by CyberConnect’s social graph, allowing users to discover and create new web3 relationships. Together, the CyberConnect and Grape Communities will explore the far reaches of this universal data layer for the next generation of dApps.

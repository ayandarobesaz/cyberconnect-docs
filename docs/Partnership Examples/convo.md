Convo integrated CyberConnect Followers, Following, Social, and Display Name fields as a source of reputation for their users. This data is then assigned a weight, used toward computing an overall trust score for any Ethereum address. Convo aims to leverage the trust score to enables user’s membership verification in categories/sources of reputation without revealing any personal traits.

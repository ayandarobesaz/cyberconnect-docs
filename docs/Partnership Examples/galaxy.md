# Galaxy ID

Project Galaxy is the largest Web3 credential data network in the world. Built on open and collaborative infrastructure, Project Galaxy helps Web3 developers and projects leverage credential data to build better products and communities. At the same time, data curators are rewarded when credentials are used in Galaxy’s Application Modules, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API.

Galaxy ID integrates CyberConnect connections data by calling our indexer API to display users’ following and followers data, thus creating their own social component in the form of Galaxy ID Cards.

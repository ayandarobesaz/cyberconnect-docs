# Unlock

Unlock is a protocol for memberships as NFTs which allows creators and communities to monetize their work, on their own terms, without having to rely on 3rd party applications or platforms. Unlock allows the ability to create NFTs with utility, access, perks, and benefits across the web - memberships that are fully owned by the communities and creators, rather than corporate platforms. Creators want to monetize their work and endure that only their members can access it, for which they can create a Lock - a smart contract deployed on Ethereum that defines the terms of their membership. The Lock belongs to the creator and can not be modified by anyone else, unless granted permission.

With membership-based communities, the notion of exclusivity plays a crucial role in their appeal. CyberConnect can feature which communities a user belongs to, as a label that's similar to a position on LinkedIn.

# What is CyberConnect
## Protocol and Interface
To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "CyberConnect", some of which may confuse new users.
- CyberConnect Protocol: A suite of infrastructure and tools including decentralized identity (DID), data storage and data indexing service that together democratize social connections, a protocol that facilitates the formation of platformless, user-centralic social graph.
- CyberConnect Interface: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the CyberConnect protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the CyberConnect protocol.

The following is a brief overview of the *CyberConnect* protocol.


## Introduction

The CyberConnect protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for the creation and storage of user-centric, self-soverign social graph and identity on any blockchain. The protocol is implmenented through a suite of components including decentralized content computation, dicentralized identity system and a distributed indexing and query engine; desigend to prioritize censorship resistance, self-sovereignty and to operate in a platformless, blockchain-agnostic manager.

### What is **Social Graph**?

By definition, the social graph is a graph that represents social relations between entities. 


You social graph 

An address book that maps social relations between individuals  
A powerful means to position an individual in a complex network of connections, organizations, affiliations, which define his/her social existence



It could present itself in different forms: An address book that maps social relations between individuals through names and phone numbers; Friend list or follower list on social platforms, defining the user's social existence among their among their network.

Examples: Facebook’s friend list, Twitter’s follower list, Mobile phone contact book


### How does CyberConnect protocol compare to a social network

People never get to 


exchanging cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

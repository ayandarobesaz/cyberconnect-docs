# Welcome to CyberConnect

## Introduction

The CyberConnect protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for the creation and storage of user-centric, self-sovereign social graphs and identity on any blockchain. The protocol is implemented through a suite of components, including decentralized content computation, decentralized identity system, and a distributed indexing and query engine. All of these components are designed to prioritize censorship resistance, self-sovereignty, and are to be operated in a platformless, blockchain agnostic manner. 

## Protocol and Interface
To begin, let’s define the difference between CyberConnect protocol and interface, which are two different offerings. The interface is what most users see and interact with, but it is not the entirety of CyberConnect.
- CyberConnect Protocol: A suite of tools, including decentralized identity (DID), data storage, and data indexing services, that are used to build the decentralized social infrastructure. CyberConnect Protocol aims to democratize social connections and facilitate the formation of platformless, user-centric social graphs.
- CyberConnect Interface: A web interface that acts as one easy way to interact with the protocol. The interface includes the user’s view of profiles, connections, and recommendations. 

### What is a **Social Graph**?

A social graph is an address book that maps social relations between individuals. 
Social graphs come in different forms - some examples include Facebook’s friend list, Twitter’s follower list, mobile phone’s contacts list, etc. Social graphs are a powerful means to position an individual in a complex network of connections, organizations, and affiliations, all of which combined define his/her social existence.
